    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      
    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Timmy';  

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players, team);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players2 = players.slice();

    // Array.from
    const players3 = Array.from(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const players5 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    console.log(person, girl);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const girl2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Ala'});
    console.log(person, girl2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
